# What is vim
`vim` is a command-line text editor based on Bill Joy's original `vi` text editor.

# How do I Use vim
You'll need to be able to navigate the command line

# Modes
## Normal/Command [Esc]
**Normal mode** is the first mode your vim will be set as when you start it. Hitting `Esc` will revert you 
back to Normal mode from any other mode. Considered to be the *browsing* or *reading* mode, it provides you with more efficient ways to navigate and manipulate the file. 

## Insert [i]
**Insert mode** can be accessed by pressing the `i` key while in Normal mode. While in insert mode, you are able to write and enter text like in a regular text editor. 

## Visual [v]
**Visual mode** can be accessed by pressing the `v` key while in Normal mode. While in Visual mode, you are able to select characters, strings and lines before using a command to modify it.

# Commands
## Saving and Quitting
While in Normal mode, you are able to type in the `Command Palette`, the line at the very bottom of your screen.

Typing in `:q` in the command palette and hitting `Enter` will quit you out of vim.

Typing in `:q!` in the command palette and hitting `Enter` will quit you out of vim without saving.

Typing in `:w` in the command palette and hitting `Enter` save your current work.

### By Words
Word specific movements are handled by the `b`, `e` and `w` keys.

`b` - beginning of the word.

`e` - end of the word.

### Modifiers
Movement can be modified by `numbers`.

`2b` will move to the beginning of the send word.

`4l` will move 4 characters to the right.

### Moving in Lines

`#` will find the *previous* occurence of the word your cursor is under.

### Moving to Lines
`gg` will move you to the beginning of the file.

`G` will move you to the end of the file.

`36G` will move you to line 36.

### Moving in Blocks
When in Normal mode, while hovering over a`(`, `[` or `{` character, you can go to the matching `)`, `]` or `}` with the `%` key.

## Search
`/` will bring up search on the command palette. 
`/text` will search for the string `text` in the file.

`n` will move to the next instance of the string you're searching for.

`N` will move to the previous instane of the string you're searching for.

## Inserting

You can modify the commands above with `numbers` after the `d` command.

## Multiple Insert
While in Normal mode, you can insert text multiple times by modifying the `i` function with a `number`.
